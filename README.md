# Feedforward Neural Network for Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a feedforward neural network to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow for building and training the model, along with various data preprocessing and handling techniques.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes loading the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Uses oversampling techniques to balance the dataset.
- **Model Building**: Constructs a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow.
- **Model Training**: Trains the model with training data and evaluates it on test data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses the modelâ€™s performance using various metrics and visualizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction

2. Install the required packages::
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook feedforward_diabetes.ipynb

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

## Project Structure

feedforward_diabetes.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
diabetes.csv: The dataset file (ensure this is in the same directory as the notebook).
